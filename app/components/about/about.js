        Science and music have always been my passion. Both bring a sense of challenge and need for practice.
        My Bachelor&apos;s degree is in Biology, while my Master&apos;s degree is in Medical
        Science. After earning my degrees in healthcare, I decided to pursue a career in clinical
        research. I found the best parts of my job were problem solving, 
        data analysis, and creating
        tools like Excel CRMs and tracking systems. After a year in clinical research, I decided to begin
        learning programming. <br />
        <br />
        After some self study, I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp, where I learned all the skills
        for successful web development. After graduation, I began working as a front end developer for Greek
        Chapter, designing their application from scratch and adding geolocation features, such as the 
        ability to create and edit study location radiuses.<br />
        <br />
        I am now working as a developer with DashProphet, a data analysis program focused on 
        creating useful and easy to understand data visualizations.<br />
        <br />
        When I&apos;m not at the computer, I&apos;m usually playing piano and guitar, hanging out with 
        my wife and dog, or playing video games. I&apos;m always looking for new challenges and
        opportunities to learn and grow.
